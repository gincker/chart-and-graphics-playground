# A Chart and Graphics Playground: Gincker Graphics

## What is Gincker Graphics?

Gincker Graphics, much like JSFiddle as a front-end code playground, is an interactive playground for charts and graphics. It allows users to create charts and graphics
for any math function or dataset without writing any code, firing up IDE, installing libraries, or setting up a local server.
It makes graphics creation as easy as using a calculator, and graphics delivery and sharing as simple as posting a Tweet.

## Main Features

This playground has the following main features:

### Simple Interface

Gincker converts different applications into templates. It implements a common interface and standardized input/output format by encapsulating and centralizing all the 
programming and implementation details internally. As long as you work through one template, you will be able to use all the other templates to create advanced charts and 
graphics. This is because all templates on Gincker share the same user interface and input/output formats. You can simply go to gincker.com, select a proper template, 
and create your desired graphics out of the box.

### Software as a Template

Over 30 templates on the current release of Gincker not only show the power and capability of the platform, but also illustrate the procedure and format used in 
creating those graphcs. These templates cover a broad range of applications, including 2D line charts, bar charts, pie charts, 3D charts, 3D shapes, 2D and 3D 
complex-variable charts, vector-streamline charts, contour, fractal, statistical distribution functions, etc. In addition, more templates will be added to Gincker over time.

### Powerful Math Parser

The math parser on Gincker allows you to build charts and graphics by entering a standard math formula with different parameters. For example, the formula
 sin(sqrt(x^2 + y^2))/(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + a) will generate a 3D sinc chart; while the formula 
sin(z^(a+b)/((x^ a + i * y^b)^c+d * i)) will produce a pretty domain-coloring chart for the complex-variable function (here z = x + i*y and i = sqrt(-1) is an imaginary number). 
Note that a, b, c, d in the formula are parameters, which can be specified separately.

### Customization

Gincker provides rich configuration options that allows you to customize your charts and graphics. For example, Gincker provides 13 different categorical color schemes 
that can be used to specify colors for different chart series. Gincker also consists of over 100 different colormaps that define the color schemes for various types of 
visualizations, such as surface and heatmap charts. You can also customize the other elements for your charts and graphics, such as chart title, axis, gridline, background 
color, interaction with graphics, etc.

### Dynamic Output

This playground allows you to save your work to a unique URL link called gincker. This saved gincker can not only provide output results, but also bring the development 
environment directly to users. This gincker can be embedded in websites, incorporated into applications, or integrated into research papers. Users can also bookmark the 
gincker for later use or share it with friends, colleagues, or other users. Users can then use the gincker to regenerate, manipulate, modify, and customize charts and graphics.

## Chart and Graphics Models on Gincker Graphics

Currently, Gincker Graphics has implemented over 30 chart and graphics models, as shown in the following image. We'll add more graphics models to this playground over time.

## Get Started 

Even though the following video shows how to get started with the Gincker AI machine learning playground, but the process is the same for the Gincker Graphics playground.
